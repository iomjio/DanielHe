Deep Learning:
1. You tell me about an insight that you actually had while working on the project.
I was initially trying to make some sort of Vampire Survivor game with timer, selectable powerup etc, but I felt they are too much work
Instead I focused on smaller quality of life changes and tries to make the ramping power and difficulty feels as fun as possible. 
2. You tell me an insight that will help you in all (or most, at least) of the programming you do in
the future, forever.
Start from smaller problems and improve the game through iterations
3. You tell me something specific that you’re going to concretely improve.
I should submit to perforce more frequently
4. You tell me the context of how you came to this insight.
I tried to imeplement an selectable upgrade system, but couldn't convey what each upgrade does well, so instead I just decided to give the player
an all stats upgrade and get to the fun part quicker.
